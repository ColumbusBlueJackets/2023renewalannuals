    <button class="accordion class="b" ">What is the difference in renewing my season tickets into a Multi-Year Plan as opposed to an Annual Plan (season-to-season)? </button>
<div class="panel">
                <p>As a Multi-Year Plan STH, you are committing to your season tickets for the next three seasons. With that commitment, you will receive: a minimum of 3% savings than with Annual Plan pricing and a cap on your season-over-season increases of 5%. By renewing as an Annual Plan, you will be paying ~3% higher than the Multi-Year Plan each season and will not have a max increase cap of 5%, meaning the savings in the Multi-Year Plan could grow each season.  
</p>
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Is there a cancellation penalty for breaking my Multi-Year Plan?  
</button>
<div class="panel">
	<p>Yes, due to the discounts you would be receiving through the Multi-Year Plan, there would be a small cancellation fee if that plan is broken prior to the term date. The fee for Lower Bowl/Club Level accounts would be $100 per account and Upper Level would be $50 per account.  </p>

</div>
<button class="accordion"> When does the season ticket renewal window for the 2023-24 season begin?  
</button>
<div class="panel">
	<p>The early renewal window is open now and will continue through Friday, March 31st. You can renew your tickets by logging in to your My Blue Jackets Account, by contacting your Account Specialist, our Ticket Sales Office at 614-246-3350, via email at ticketsales@bluejackets.com or by visiting us at STH Central (near section 111) at any upcoming home game.   </p>
